# Bully-External_Trainner

This is my first external trainer for games.
I chose to start with Bully because it is an epic game and because it provides simpler reverse engineering compared to other games.
This Trainer was created for the purpose of study and practice only.

<strong>Knowledge acquired in the Trainer creation process:</strong><br/>
- C++ Programming, <br/>
- Reverse engineering,<br/>
- Cheat Engine,<br/>
- Find Pointers, Offsets, Entity List...<br/>

# Using:
- To use the hack just compile the Trainner using Visual Studio.
Some anti-virus detect the trainer as malware due to its functions.
